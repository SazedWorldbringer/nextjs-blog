Today was a comparatively productive day.

I made a React Avatar component using TypeScript, like in GitHub,
following Joe Previte's small course.
He used TDD using Vitest while creating the component,
which is something I'm trying out right now, so that was helpful.

Wrote a blog post walking through setting up
a React + TypeScript app with Vitest for testing,
which I learnt from Joe's course.

Went and did the usual exercise. Ran around a kilometer,
and today was leg day for me, so they're absolutely destroyed.

And, at last, I'm writing this journal entry.

A, sort of, productive day indeed. Lets try and work harder!
